# Guessing-Game
A number guessing game. 
The CPU will generate a random number between 1-10. You will have 5 attempts to guess the correct number. If you succeed, a window will alert you of your victory. Along the way, the game will track how many attempts you have done.
If you reach 5 attempts, you will receive a Game Over window and the game will end.
